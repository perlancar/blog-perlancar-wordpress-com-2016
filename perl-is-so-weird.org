#+TITLE: PERL is so weird

* how many young programmers stumbled upon perl ()
* perl programmers are so old
* length(@array) = BOOM
* $foo != @foo != %foo
* sintaks untuk access elements: $foo->{bar}
* OO is weird, then Moose is startup heavy and installs like XXX dists
* default cpan client is old
* tutorials on the web is 1990s and CGI
* autovivification
* context
* no boolean
* no core
3) no builtin clone() function. Data::Clone is not core, Clone::PP is not core,
   Clone is not core, Storable is core but … JSON is too simplistic and not
   core. YAML is not core. Data::Dumper is, well… Everything is slowish to
   superslow to hyperslow. Sereal is not core. Perhaps at least make Sereal
   core?
