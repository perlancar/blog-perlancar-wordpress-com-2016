 <b>About this series:</b> A collection of short blog posts about <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/lcpan">lcpan</a> tips/recipes. Some posts will also end up in the upcoming <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/App::lcpan::Manual::Cookbook">App::lcpan::Manual::Cookbook</a> POD to be included in the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/App::lcpan">App::lcpan</a> distribution. <a href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/lcpan-tips-001-doc/">First article is here</a>. <a href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/tag/lcpan-tips/">See the whole series</a>. 
<p><b>About lcpan:</b> an application to download and index a mini CPAN mirror on your local filesystem, so in effect you will have something like your own CPAN with a command-line tool (or perl API) to query and extract information from your mirror. I find it perfect for my own personal use when working offline. 
<p>A <a href="https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/lcpan-tips-002-install-cpan-distribution-when-you-only-know-a-scripts-name/">previous tip</a> shares this recipe to install a CPAN distribution by mentioning its script name: 
<p><pre class="fixed_width_section">% cpanm -n `lcpan script2mod pm-uninstall`
</pre>
 Since then, two convenient utilities have been added: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm-script">cpanm-script</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/lcpanm-script">lcpanm-script</a>. The first one is a thin wrapper over <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm">cpanm</a>, while the second one is a thin wrapper over <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/lcpanm">lcpanm</a> (which is itself a thin wrapper over cpanm). They basically work the same as the above recipe: given a script name, look up the distribution name the script is included in then convert it to module name, and then pass it to cpanm. 
<p>Being simple thin wrappers, {,l}cpanm-script do not add command-line options of their own but simply convert the script name to module name and pass the rest of the options. For example, when a script with the same name exists in multiple distributions (e.g. <tt>hangman</tt>) only the first one is chosen to be installed. If you want to install all of them, you can use: 
<p><pre class="fixed_width_section">% cpanm -n `lcpan script2mod pm-uninstall`
</pre>
 However, these scripts offer another convenience: tab completion. 
<p><pre class="fixed_width_section">% lcpanm-script -&lt;Tab&gt;
% lcpanm-script hang&lt;Tab&gt;
</pre>
 It&#39;s better to enter a few characters first to prevent the completion routine from trying to retrieve the whole list of scripts on CPAN. </body>
