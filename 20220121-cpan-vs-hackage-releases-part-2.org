#+TITLE: CPAN vs Hackage releases, Part 2

Continuing from the [[https://perlancar.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/cpan-vs-hackage-releases-part-1/][first part]], I managed to collect data from Jan to Jul 2021
but unfortunately in the middle of August my VM got rebooted and I forgot to
re-run the collecting script so these are all the full months 2021 data that I
have.

| Period   | CPAN releases | CPAN authors | Hackage releases | Hackage authors |
|----------+---------------+--------------+------------------+-----------------|
| Jan 2021 |          1184 |          229 |              574 |             229 |
| Feb 2021 |          1016 |          223 |              737 |             220 |
| Mar 2021 |          1001 |          229 |              783 |             258 |
| Apr 2021 |           979 |          230 |              540 |             193 |
| Jun 2021 |           982 |          220 |              491 |             170 |
| Jul 2021 |           951 |          187 |              562 |             195 |

Draw the conclusion yourself. I end my curiosity here, but might compare again
in the future.
